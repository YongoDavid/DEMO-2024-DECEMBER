# DEMO-2024-DECEMBER
A quote  is made begining of this year "Welcome to 2024 David You came into the year DEVELOPER and by the end of this year i will be 10times better"
THIS IS THE LAST MONTH OF 2024 AND INDEED I AM 10 TIMES BETTER AS A DEVELOPER, THERE HAVE BEEN UPS AND DOWNS BUT I DID NOT GIVE UP , THIS IS JUST THE BEGINING DAVID,
THERE IS A LOT TO CONQUER.
FROM USING A BAD SCREEN TO WORK FOR 4 MOTHNS AND STILL BUILDING PROJECTS REGARDLESS ,  I AM PROUD OF MYSELF , CONSISTENCY REALLY PAYS OFF.
KEEP GOING , THE GRIND DOESNT STOP!!! GOD HELP ME.
